For me, and I suspect many others, the greatest barrier to overcoming life's challenges has always been self-doubt. I'm sure somewhere there is a person with unwavering confidence, who meets each new crisis with the enthusiasm of a seasoned dragonslayer and dispatches them promptly with a few deft and graceful strokes of the sword. For the sake of argument, let's call her Becky. Becky never has a moment of doubt, because she knows that her skills and determination will greatly exceed any adversity that might come her way.

I hate Becky. But she won't let that phase her.

For the rest of us, however, there is doubt. And one of my greatest moments of doubt came in the later phases of the foundation portion of [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io)'s 'Rails Web Development' course. We were building a functional clone of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and up until this point, there had been a steady oscillation of increased challenge and greater accomplishment. Things were making sense, and I was beginning to feel that I was actually cut out for all of this.

That changed very quickly in a section involving many-to-many relationships and polymorphism. Suddenly there was a barrage of new objects to manage (all with very similar names) that connected to each other in ways we hadn't seen before. Not only were those ways not particularly well explained, but there were snippets of code we were told to add that ended up breaking our current tests.

It was beyond frustrating. I decided this was not the field for me and was ready to quit and ask for the rest of my tuition back. That's when Bloc's largest shortcoming (a frequently-revised curriculum that sometimes contains remnants of old and incompatible code) gave way to it's greatest strength: the mentors.

My mentor worked with me to identify issues in the text and report them to Bloc so they could be fixed for future students. He helped me through the section so I could accomplish the objectives and move on. He even convinced Bloc to extend my course by a week to make up for the time lost struggling with the flawed material. But most importantly, he gave me the confidence to not only finish the foundation and the required projects, but to go beyond the requirements and build additional, more complex projects.

As I write this, I am 80% of the way through the duration of the course with 133% of the objectives completed. I was almost permanently derailed, but with the much-needed support of my mentor, I not only have new skills that I would never have dreamed of a year ago, but I have a lot more confidence and maybe even a little less envy.

You know what... You go, Becky! Slay those dragons!
