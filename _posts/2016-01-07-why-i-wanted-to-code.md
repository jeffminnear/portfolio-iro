title: Why I Wanted to Code

I've wanted to learn to write code since long before I really knew what code was. I grew up playing shareware games, delighted by the worlds on the screen, but fascinated and intimidated by the magical numbers underneath. Like most people (I think), I envisioned programmers typing endless streams of 1's and 0's like wizards weaving an arcane spell in a dark, forbidden tongue. It was mysterious, and I have always been drawn to mystery.

Now that I have a better understanding of what code really is, I find it no less fascinating. In fact, the opposite is true. To learn that code, far from being magic, is simply a well organized and logically structured series of commands carried out in precise order to accomplish a given task is to realize two things. The first is that coding, like music or woodworking, is a discipline; it was created, refined, maintained, and expanded by dedicated and passionate people. The second is that it is within your reach.

Magic is fantasy. Code is art.
